**SPXVisuals.github.io**

SPXVisuals.github.io is the static front-end that displays equity market visualizations generated by the Generator pipeline. The site consumes structured JSON metadata and chart images pushed by the pipeline to dynamically render interactive and publication-ready analytics.

**Core Responsibilities**
- Displays charts and insights generated by the Generator pipeline
- Renders both quantitative analytics (price, returns, volume, leader/laggard rankings) and fundamental metrics (market cap, P/E ratios, valuations)
- Dynamically updates as new data and metadata are published
- Serves as a lightweight, static front-end for distributing SPX market insights

**Data Flow**

1. Generator pipeline produces:
- Chart images
- Structured JSON metadata describing each chart and its metrics
- Metadata and images are pushed to this repository

2. Front-end JavaScript reads the JSON and renders:
- Charts on the dashboard
- Descriptive summaries
- Social media references/links to posts

**Tech Stack**
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- JSON

**Deployment**
- Hosted as a GitHub Pages static site
- Fully automated update when Generator pushes new charts and metadata

**Usage**
- Navigate to SPXVisuals.github.io
- The site automatically displays the latest analytics and charts from the Generator pipeline
- No manual intervention required; all updates are automated
